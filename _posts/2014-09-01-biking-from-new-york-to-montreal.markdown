## Day 1: Manhattan to Poughkeepsie, NY (83 miles)

Crossed over the George Washington Bridge to west side of the Hudson river. Up 9W through Nyack, Haverstraw and Bear Mountain. Took a detour in Bear Mountain State Park to check out Iona Island, a bird sanctuary with a reputation for serving as a home to bald eagles (didn't catch any).

Crossed over the Bear Mountain Bridge back to the eastern side of the Hudson. Rode up Rt. 90 through the Hudson Highlands and Beacon until finally reaching Poughkeepsie before sundown. Poughkeepsie is home to Vassar College, a small liberal arts school.
