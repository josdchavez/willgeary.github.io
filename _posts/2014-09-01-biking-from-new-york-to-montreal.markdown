## Day 1: Manhattan to Poughkeepsie, NY (83 miles)

Crossed over the George Washington Bridge to west side of the Hudson river. Up 9W through Nyack, Haverstraw and Bear Mountain. Took a detour in Bear Mountain State Park to check out Iona Island, a bird sanctuary with a reputation for serving as a home to bald eagles (didn't catch any).
