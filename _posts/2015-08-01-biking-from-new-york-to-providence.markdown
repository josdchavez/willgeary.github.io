### Day 1: Brooklyn to Orient Point, NY (110 miles)

Starting from Brookyln, I rode through sprawling Long Island all the way to Orient Point, the very tip of the north fork of long island, which is quiet and beautiful. Stealth camped on the beach in Orient Beach State Park. Fell asleep to a violently purple sky and the sounds of waves gently lapping at the shore.
