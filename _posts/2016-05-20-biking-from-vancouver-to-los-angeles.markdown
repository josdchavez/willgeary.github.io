I'm planning to bike from Vancouver to LA this summer.

The trip would consist of:

### 1. Train from New York to St. Albans, Vermont

As of May 1 2016, Amtrak allows passengers to [bring bikes on-board](http://media.amtrak.com/2016/04/amtrak-now-offers-bike-service-on-the-vermonter/) the *Vermonter* train. Just in time! I'll plan to take the train up from New York to St. Albans, a small city in Vermont north of Burlington and south of the Canadian Border.

### 2. Bike from St. Albans, Vermont to Montreal (76 miles)

I've done this ride before. It's a beauty. I'll head right to the metro station in Montreal to catch a train to Vancounver.

### 3. Train from Montreal to Vancouver (3 days)

This one's a doozy. VIA Rail runs from Montreal to Vancouver in three days. This seems like more fun than flying to Vancouver. It's also cheaper, doesn't require me to disassemble my bicycle, and affords the chance to soak in the scenery of Western Canada.

### 4. Bike from Vancouver to Astoria, Oregon (401 miles)
