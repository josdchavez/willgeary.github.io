I'm planning a bike tour this summer from Vancouver to LA. 

The trip would consist of:

## 1. Train from New York to St. Albans, Vermont.

As of May 1 2016, Amtrak allows passengers to [bring bikes](http://media.amtrak.com/2016/04/amtrak-now-offers-bike-service-on-the-vermonter/) on-board the *Vermonter* train.
