Most police officers don't live in the cities they serve.

I was intrigued by Nate Silver's fantastic post on his blog FiveThirtyEight titled [*Most Police Don’t Live In The Cities They Serve*](http://fivethirtyeight.com/datalab/most-police-dont-live-in-the-cities-they-serve/).

Silver writes:

> In Ferguson, Missouri, where protests continue following the shooting of a teenager by a police officer this month, more than two-thirds of the civilian population is black. Only 11 percent of [the police force is](http://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2014/aug/17/andrea-mitchell/ferguson-police-department-has-50-white-officers-t/). The racial disparity is troubling enough on its own, but it’s also suggestive of another type of misrepresentation. Given Ferguson’s racial gap, it’s likely that many of its police officers live outside city limits.

This metric is heavily dependent on race. Black and Hispanic police officers are more likely to reside in the cities they serve than white officers.

This data comes from the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) and the Census Bureau, which together provide detail on the racial composition of government workers in large American cities. We were alerted to the data set by a [Washington Post analysis](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2014/08/14/where-minority-communities-still-have-overwhelmingly-white-police/) of the racial demographics of each city’s police force. The census data also includes detail on how many police officers live in the cities where they serve.

Silver visualizes this metric by ethnicity for each city in the census in the below figure. I think this is a very effective visualization because it answers several important questions in one clear, aesthetically-appealing, self-explantory scatter plot.
