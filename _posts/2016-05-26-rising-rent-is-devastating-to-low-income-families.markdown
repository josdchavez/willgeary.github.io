Low-income Americans can no longer afford rent, food, and transportation.

This post was inspired by this [Vox article](http://www.vox.com/2016/3/30/11330832/low-income-households-cant-afford-basic-needs) by Soo Oh. 

> A new Pew Charitable Trusts analysis of data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics shows that in 2013, low-income Americans spent a median of $6,897 on housing. In 2014, that rose to $9,178 â€” the biggest jump in housing spending for the 19-year period of data that Pew studied.

> The cost of other necessities, like transportation and food, also rose, albeit not as dramatically. 2014 was the first year that Pew studied in which median spending on these three categories was higher than the median income for those in the lower third of income groups.
