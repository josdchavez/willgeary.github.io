## Why?
When I tell people that I actually *enjoy* going on long, multi-day bicycle rides, I encounter a diverse range of responses. 

Those who "get it" will share feelings of mutual excitement, respect and a special sympathy. These folks are typically hikers, runners, fellow cyclists, or other flavors of wandering souls who understand the appeal and psychic effects of self-powered adventuring through urban and natural geographies.

Others will stare at me with a mix of admiration and disbelief. *You're biking how far?* they say, shaking their head. To the uninitiated, an orientation like mine implies a nearly superhuman endurance and a sadistic sense of pleasure. Or perhaps it suggests that you are struggling to recover from some personal affliction or tragedy. *You'll be just like Reese Witherspoon in [Wild](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2305051/)!*

Still others will simply ask *why?* As in, *why wouldn't you just drive there?*

Well, there are several reasons.

## Quiet Mind Times
When you spend good, long hours exploring the beauty of your surrounding environment, looking at seemingly endless terrain, conversing with companions of the road, or reflecting on the universe and your purpose in it, you become attuned to your inner self. These periods of introspection, which I like to call *quiet mind times*, are needed by all people but seemingly enjoyed by only few. 

It is easy to tune out. Life often requires us to focus on getting through places for practical reasons (getting to school, getting to work, etc), such that we overlook the experience of being in them. In a *Field Guide to Getting Lost*, Rebecca Solnit celebrates the value of the small wonders that many of us tend to ignore or hustle past without noticing at all. Part of the philosophy is no philosophy at all - rather a sense of wonder, an open mind, and the capacity to see and feel more than just what can be defined.

> When I walk, what happens is more vague, more ambiguous — and in many circumstances much richer. I am out in the world. It’s exercise, though not so quantifiably as on a treadmill in a gym with a digital readout. It’s myriad little epiphanies and encounters that knit me more tightly into my place and maybe enhance the place overall. The carbon emissions are essentially nil. Many more benefits are more subjective, more ethereal — and more wordy. You can’t describe them in a few familiar phrases; and if you’re not practiced at describing them, you may not be able to articulate them at all. It is difficult to value what cannot be named. Since someone makes money every time you buy a car or fill it up, there’s a whole commercial language built around getting us to drive; there’s little or no language promoting the free act of walking. - Rebecca Solnit

## The Bicycle as a Psychogeographic Tool
The physical environment impacts our internal environment, and vice versa. [Psychogeography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychogeography) is an approach to understanding the conscious and subconscious effects of the geographic environment on human emotions and behavior. It is a sort of pseudo-scientific, tongue-in-cheek approach to social geography that posits playful "drifting" around urban environments as method of sparking a new awareness of the built environment. Psychogeography originated in the 1950s by an avant-garde group of Parisian artists and theorists known as The [Letterist International](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letterist_International) who might be thought of as French counterparts of the American Beat Generation. An interest in this field continues to persist in some form. There is even a conference in New York City dedicated to psychogeography called [Psy.Geo.Conflux](http://confluxfestival.org/schedule/).

> Most of us follow a small set of preprogrammed instructions as we wander through the city: office, day care, grocery store, home. If you track your own path through a typical day, you'll soon discover that your journey is habitual, that you're slowly wearing a canyon through the same streets, the same sidewalks, day after day. Psychogeography encourages us to buck the rut, to follow some new logic that lets us experience our landscape anew, that forces us to truly see what we'd otherwise ignore. Chance and randomness are what's exciting. - Joseph Hart, [A New Way of Walking](http://www.utne.com/community/a-new-way-of-walking.aspx)
