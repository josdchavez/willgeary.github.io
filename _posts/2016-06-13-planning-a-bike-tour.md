## Why?
When I tell people that I actually *enjoy* going on long, multi-day bicycle rides, I encounter a diverse range of responses. 

Those who "get it" will share feelings of mutual excitement, respect and a special sympathy. These folks are typically hikers, runners, fellow cyclists, or other flavors of wandering souls who understand the appeal and psychic effects of self-powered adventuring through urban and natural geographies.

Others will stare at me with a mix of admiration and disbelief. *You're biking how far?* they say, shaking their head. To the uninitiated, an orientation like mine implies a nearly superhuman endurance and suggests a demented sense of pleasure. Or perhaps it suggests that you are struggling to recover from some personal affliction or tragedy. *You'll be just like Reese Witherspoon in [Wild](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2305051/)!*

Still others will simply ask *why?* As in, *why wouldn't you just drive there?*

Well, there are several reasons.

## Quiet Mind Times
When you spend good, long hours exploring the beauty of your surrounding environment, looking at seemingly endless terrain, conversing with companions of the road, or reflecting on the universe and your purpose in it, you become attuned to your inner self. These periods of introspection, which I like to call *quiet mind times*, are needed by all people but seemingly enjoyed by only few. 

It is easy to tune out. Life often requires us to focus on getting through places for practical reasons (getting to school, getting to work, etc), such that we overlook the experience of being in them. In a *Field Guide to Getting Lost*, Rebecca Solnit celebrates the value of the small wonders that many of us tend to ignore or hustle past without noticing at all. Part of the philosophy is no philosophy at all - rather a sense of wonder, an open mind, and the capacity to see and feel more than just what can be defined.
