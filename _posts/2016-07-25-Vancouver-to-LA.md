I'm currently riding my bicycle down the Pacific Coast! I took a three day sleeper train from Montreal to Vancouver with my bicycle in tow. I left Vancouver on July 17th and am cycling down the Oregon coast at the moment, on track to meet my goal of arriving in LA by the August 25th. From LA, I'll catch a three day train back home to New York. I've been able to camp in state parks every night thus far and am loving it. Follow along and check out my route below!
