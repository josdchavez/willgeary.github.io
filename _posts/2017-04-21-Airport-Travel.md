Comparing travel times from Times Square (Manhattan) to each of New York City's major airports, according to Google Maps Directions API. Each trip leaves at 6pm on Friday, April 21, 2017. LGA by car wins (21 mins), JFK by transit loses (49 mins).

Made with Processing and Unfolding Maps.

Here is my [Python notebook](https://github.com/willgeary/AirportTravelTimes) used to retreive duration estimates and routes from Google Maps Directions API and decode Google Maps polylines into GeoJSON.
