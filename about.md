I'm Will Geary, an aspiring data scientist living in Brooklyn, New York.

I've worked as an analyst at established companies and early-stage startups. Currently, I'm a full-time graduate student at Columbia University pursuing a [master's degree in data science](http://datascience.columbia.edu/master-of-science-in-data-science). Iâ€™m excited about the implications of machine learning and computer vision on sustainability and mobility in cities of the future. 

I ride my bicycle every day and dream about biking, hiking and camping my way around the world. I love cities and have a [street photography habit](https://www.instagram.com/willcgeary/).
