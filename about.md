My passion is to use data to solve real world problems. I'm motivated by a concern for sustainability and mobility in cities of the future.

I ride my bicycle every day and dream about biking, hiking and camping my way around the world. During the July and August of 2016, I rode by bike from [Vancouver to Los Angeles](http://willgeary.github.io/biking/2016/07/25/Vancouver-to-LA.html). I love cities and have a [street photography habit](https://www.instagram.com/willcgeary/).
