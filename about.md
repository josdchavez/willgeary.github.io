I'm a data science master's student at Columbia University. My background is in business analytics and strategic finance. My interests lie at the intersection of data science and sustainable, human-oriented urban design.

I love anything outdoors, and I'm crazy about the bicycle. I ride to work every day and dream about biking, hiking and camping my way around the world. I love cities and have a street photography habit.
