I'm an incoming M.S. in Data Science candidate at Columbia University. My background is in data analytics and strategic finance. My interests lie at the intersection of data science and sustainable, human-oriented urban design.

Previously...

* Company Partnerships at Venture for America, a non-profit revitalizing American cities through entrepreneurship. My job is to identify and build partnerships with early-stage startups and key stakeholders in cities across the U.S.

* Finance & Strategy Lead at Food52, a venture-backed startup in New York getting people excited about cooking. I built a business analytics framework, created a five-year financial model and raised $6 million in venture capital.

* Investment Banking Analyst at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Advised and executed on M&A, debt and equity transactions. Learned a lot about financial modeling, spreadsheets, powerpoints, sleeping under my desk...

* B.S. in Economics & B.A. in Philosophy from Duke University, 2012

I love anything outdoors, and I'm crazy about the bicycle. I ride to work every day and dream about biking, hiking and camping my way around the world. I love cities and have a street photography habit.
