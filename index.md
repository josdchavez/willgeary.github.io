I'm Will Geary, an aspiring data scientist living in Brooklyn, New York.

Starting in Fall 2016, I'll be pursuing a [master's degree in data science](http://datascience.columbia.edu/master-of-science-in-data-science) at Columbia University, studying machine learning, data mining and advanced statistical theory. I'm excited about the intersection of data science and urban mobility.

Feel free to read more [about me](about), follow my [bicycle adventures](/bikes) and [data projects](data), or reach out!
