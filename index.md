I'm **Will Geary**, an aspiring data scientist living in Brooklyn, New York.

Currently, I'm a graduate student at Columbia University pursuing a [master's degree in data science](http://datascience.columbia.edu/master-of-science-in-data-science). 

I'm excited about the intersection of data science and urban planning. Inspired by the likes of Jan Gehl, William Whyte, Jane Jacobs and Janette Sadik-Khan, my desire is to make cities happier, healthier and more sustainable. I believe that urban transportation is going to change drastically over the next few decades, and I'd like to be a part of that.
