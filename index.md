I'm Will Geary, an aspiring data scientist living in Brooklyn, New York.

Starting in Fall 2016, I'll be pursuing a [master's degree in data science](http://datascience.columbia.edu/master-of-science-in-data-science) at Columbia University.

I'm excited about the implications of machine learning and computer vision on sustainability and mobility in cities of the future. Inspired by Jan Gehl, William Whyte, Jane Jacobs and Janette Sadik-Khan, I see urban transportation not only as a matter of convenience and economics but of social justice and equality. Human mobility is going to change drastically over the next few decades, and I'm eager to be a part of that.
