I'm Will Geary, an aspiring data scientist living in Brooklyn, New York.

Currently, I'm pursuing a [master's degree in data science](http://datascience.columbia.edu/master-of-science-in-data-science) at Columbia University.

I'm excited about the implications of data science on sustainability and mobility in cities of the future. Inspired by Jan Gehl, William Whyte, Jane Jacobs and Janette Sadik-Khan, I see urban transportation not only as a matter of convenience and economics but of social justice and equality. Human mobility is going to change drastically over the next few decades, and I'm eager to be a part of that.
